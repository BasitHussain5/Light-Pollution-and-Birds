# Impact of Artificial Light Pollution on Bird Behavior in Bangladesh

## Overview
This repository contains the data, methodology, analysis, and results for a research study investigating the effects of artificial light pollution on bird behavior across six ecologically diverse districts in Bangladesh. The study integrates satellite-derived light pollution data with long-term bird observation records and applies machine learning techniques to model and predict avian responses to light pollution.

## How to Use

1. **Explore Data:**  
   Review the datasets in the `data/` folder. Bird observation data and light pollution data are preprocessed for integration.

2. **Run Analysis:**  
   Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to reproduce exploratory analyses, visualizations, and machine learning models.

3. **Review Results:**  
   See the generated figures in `figures/` and consult the final paper (`paper.pdf`) for detailed findings.

## Machine Learning Models

The study employs multiple algorithms to predict bird behavioral changes due to artificial light, including:  
- Random Forest Regression  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)  
- Neural Networks  

Performance metrics such as MAE, R², and F1-score are used to evaluate these models.
